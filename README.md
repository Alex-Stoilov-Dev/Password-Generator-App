# Password Generator

A python application that generates passwords.

This application utilizes tkinter for GUI, and the "random" and "string" libraries for convenience.

The application supports all ASCII characters, and generates passwords of variable lengths.

The passwords can be range from 8 characters long up to 32 characters long.

It also has clipboard support, so you can copy your generated password from the UI, or you can copy it by selecting the text box.
