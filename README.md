# Password Generator

A python application that generates passwords.

This application utilizes tkinter for GUI, and the "random" and "string" libraries for convenience.

The application supports all ASCII characters, and can support variable password lengths.

The passwords can be as short as 8 characters and as long as 32 characters.

It also has clipboard support, so you can copy your generated password directly into your clipboard.
